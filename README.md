Project: Forecasting Wine Quality üç∑

Goal: Use machine learning to forecast wine quality based on chemical characteristics like acidity and density.

Standouts:

Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Stochastic Gradient Descent models were put into practice.
analysed chemical properties using Numpy and Pandas.
used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualise data patterns.
Result: Provided insights into the prediction of wine quality, improving comprehension of machine learning applications in the wine industry.
